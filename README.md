# The_Owlery
Website to provide a community for Hogwarts Legacy enthusiasts where they may share their thoughts and characters.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:**
HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, Apache

For the design of this site, I used HTML and CSS. Server-side, I used PHP and sessions in order to allow users to signup/login. Users cannot post anything without signing in. All user data is stored in a .txt file as of right now. They may provide comments or questions on the forum page. Users can upload .jpeg files of their characters and YouTube video links of their Room of Requirement. These .jpegs and YT links are embedded in the correct page once uploaded. 

## What's Next:
There are quite a few features I would like to update or add to the site. I would like to connect the user information with a database so the data will not be stored in a .txt file. I would like for users to be able to comment on each other's posts as well. Eventually I would like to provide a walkthrough so users can get help when stuck in the game.
