aviendha---I LOVE THIS GAME---This game is everything I hoped it would be. The world is so detailed but it is the castle that really gets me! I have spent hours just wandering around, finding all of my favorite spots from the books. What is your favorite part of the game so far?
aviendha---More Quests at Hogwarts---I really love this game, however I wish there were more quests at Hogwarts. I want to interact with the students! Having to go out in to the Highlands for most quests feels like it is breaking my immersion as a Hogwarts student. Give me more things to do at Hogwarts!!
